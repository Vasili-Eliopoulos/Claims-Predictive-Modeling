# Claims-Predictive-Modeling

Attempt at building a classifier model to predict fraud in the auto insurance claims. The model is trained and applied to a claims dataset from Kaggle.

The bulk of the code is repurposed from a multiclass classification project I completed to classify fetal health based on a fetal cardiotocography dataset from Kaggle.
